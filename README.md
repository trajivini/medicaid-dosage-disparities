# Dosage Disparities: Medicaid Reimbursement Trends and Predictive Insights

## Overview
This capstone project investigates Medicaid drug reimbursement trends across U.S. states from 2019 to 2024, with a focus on dosage disparities and socioeconomic drivers. We developed predictive models to analyze and forecast units reimbursed using variables like GDP, poverty rates, personal income, and climate.

**Tools Used**: Python, R, SQL, XGBoost, LightGBM, Linear Regression

## Key Contributions
- Merged over 10 million records across Medicaid and socioeconomic datasets
- Applied advanced preprocessing (target mean encoding with cross-validation)
- Built and evaluated predictive models (MLR, LightGBM, XGBoost)
- Achieved highest model RÂ² of 0.93 with RMSE 41,991.16
- Conducted cost-benefit analysis estimating $24M in potential savings with improved accuracy
